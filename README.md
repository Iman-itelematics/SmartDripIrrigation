#Smart Drip Irrigation using IOT 

<h2>Abstract</h2>
   <p>Designing a rover which senses the moisture of the soil and switches ON the drip irrigation system if required. The whole system will be based on IOT.

Wherever it moves in the farm the irrigation system will be switch ON or OFF based on its location and requirement of irrigation </p>
